After burning out of uni, I took a break from coding and study and now im back and studying with a passion I've never felt before, this is (hopefully) the result/notes on anything I do.

These notes are engineered for maximal efficiency for myself and as such I do not promise them to helpful study aids for anyone (also taking notes is the act of study it self in many cases)

Using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as the note making tool of choice
also practicing proper maths markdown


Started on 18.09.2024
Currently going through Introduction to [[Crypto]] by Cristof Paar

Probably going through parts of [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) later (I already have a decent bg for the basics from my Uni years but probably gonna go through maths parts again to form a more intuitive understanding, so skipping intro CS and core CS for sure other things under consideration)
Passed most of the needed classes for the first half of the Computer Engineering Degree in University of Tart (around 90 EAP)
