IM USING = as equivalence in parts of this file which is wrong BTW its 3 lines 
this problem is not seen in other files

numbers that are the same modulo something 
e.g 7, 2, -3 mod 5
distance is equal between them


modulo 5 Z
{.. -5 0 5 10 ..} A 
{.. -9 -4 1 6 ..} B
and so on
every set inf elements
5 sets (equal to mod distance basically)
over 5 sets we get all ints

All members of a class are for our case equivalent
13 * 16-8=208-8= 200 mod 5 $\equiv$ 0 mod 5
D * B - D
(mod 5) 3 * 1 -3 = 0
this applies to all members of these classes mod whatever
# shits very cool

ex 3^8 mod 7 = ?
1st way is actually doing this shit which seems dumb
2nd way is prolly 3^8 = 3^4 x 3^4 = 81 x 81
at which point we can use equivalence classes pretty easily
so equivalence 4 x 4 mod 7 = 16 mod 7 = 2 mod 7
All equivalence classes smallest number together for a given mod give us a [[Rings]]
