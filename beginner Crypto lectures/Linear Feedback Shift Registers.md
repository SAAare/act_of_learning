n [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), a **linear-feedback shift register** (**LFSR**) is a [shift register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register "Shift register") whose input bit is a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear#Boolean_functions "Linear") of its previous state. (wikipedia)

ie LSSR 
flipflops in a row where the inputs are shift
initial values, we see the last as $S_i$

LFSR has some feedback for example xor ^ of two first inputs

### Crypto: stream ciphers
small in hardware good for this use
e.g AS/1 cipher in GSM- 3 LFSR

[[flip-flop]]
Explained in [[NAND to tetris]]
stores inputs on clock pulses
