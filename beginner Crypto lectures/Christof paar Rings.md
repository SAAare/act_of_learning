# Algebraic view of mod arithmetic

The integer ring $\mathcal Z_m$consists of
1. The set  = {0,1,2,3,4,...,m-1}
2. The operators "+" and " * " such that
   $\forall a, b \in \mathcal Z_m$
   (a) $a+b\equiv c\mod m$ $c\in \mathcal Z_m$
   (b) $a*b \equiv d\mod m$ $d\in \mathcal Z_m$
addition multiplication associative
there is the neutral 0 for addition
there is always an additive inverse $a+(-a)=0\mod m$
i.e m=6
$4+2 \equiv 0 \mod 6$
there is the neutral 1 for multiplicative
multiplicative inverse may exist for a given number
(defined as) $a*a^{-1} \equiv 1\mod m$

i.e m=9
if a=2 then $2^{-1}$=5
if it does exist
we can divide by it
$b/a \equiv b*a^-1)$
condition for a number to have a multiplicative inverse to exist is
gcd(a,m)=1
