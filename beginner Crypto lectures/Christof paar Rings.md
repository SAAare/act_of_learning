# Algebraic view of mod arithmetic
rings aka residue classes
The integer ring $\mathcal Z_m$consists of
1. The set  = {0,1,2,3,4,...,m-1}
2. The operators "+" and " * " such that
   $\forall a, b, c, d \in \mathcal Z_m$
   (a) $a+b\equiv c\pmod m$

Okay you can figure this out yourself this explanation lecture is bad searching for the book ...
